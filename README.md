# Memory Game

A simple game where the goal is to match a pair of cards.
You start by choosing how many cards you want to play with.  After the game starts you select two cards.  
If the cards match they turn green and stay flipped up.  If they don't, they turn red then flip back down.  Make too many
mismatches brings the star rating down.  The number of mismatches needed before the star rating drops depends on how many 
cards there are.
